# Smart-Street-Parking-Using-openCV
The project uses two files namely Parkingspacepicker.Ipynb File and Main.Ipnyb File, of  which the former is used to select or deselect the Parking Spaces to check if the parking space is empty or occupied and the latter is used to give the actual count of the empty parking spaces available in the Parking Lot.
